## Objective

  Write a sorting algorithm in C called push_swap which calculates and displays
  on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions,
  that sorts the integers received as arguments.
  
  
  Sorting values is simple. To sort them the fastest way possible is less simple. Especially
  because from one integers configuration to another, the most efficient sorting solution can
  differ.
